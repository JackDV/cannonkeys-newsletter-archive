**Kitty KAT** is now **IN STOCK** and Live on CannonKeys! This light grey on dark
grey set was designed by Minterly and also features green accent keys!
There are the following kits available:

TKL, 40s, Ortho, Numpad, Spacebar, UK

Each primary kit is designed to cover a complete keyboard - no splitting of
alphas and mods!

If you need numpad, spacebar, or UK ISO coverage, those kits are available.

 **~~Buy it Here Quickly, before it sells out!~~** 
 
There are also two matching deskmats available to go with Kitty KAT! These
are available from Minterly Studios as well, so you can pick the vendor with the
cheaper shipping cost for yourself!

## Onyx Keyboard by Funderburker

Hopefully by now, you've heard of the Onyx keyboard by Funderburker! There
have been a couple build streams from Apiary and Minterly, and Minterly also
made a sound test video that you can check out!

We'll have **300 units** available, which we hope is a good enough amount to
satisfy demand given its **$520 price**. Our group buy will open at **11 AM Eastern
on Feb 20th,** and we will be using our [raffle queue system](https://docs.cannonkeys.com/raffle-queue/).

Speaking of our raffle queue system - we are making some changes for this
round. The actual raffle queue system itself isn't changing, **but options will be
selected via a Google Form that will be emailed out after an Onyx
keyboard purchase**. If someone does not select options, we will select options
for them! We're making this change in order to allow for flexibility in selecting
and changing options, so a rushed checkout shouldn't impact a user's final
choices.

With that in mind - we also want to remind everyone that our order editing
system will still work. If you want to add an item to your order (for example, the
E-white addon, or a polycarbonate half-plate) you can do so using our order
editing system. Removing items will require a support ticket, and removed
items will be subject to a 3% cancellation fee.

The Onyx group buy will close no earlier than F**ebruary 26th, 2021 at 6 PM
EASTERN**. Order edits and form edits will also close at this time.This is a bit
different from prior group buys in terms of time of day, but we want to be able to
have time to lock in selections and place the order with the manufacturer ASAP,
before others place their orders right after Chinese New Year.

Check out the Group Buy thread on [Geekhack](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=111130.msg3012068#msg3012068) to learn more about board
details and pricing.

Note: The Iron165 Round 2 Group Buy will follow this same format.
